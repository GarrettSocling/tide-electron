# Tide

A cross-platform IDE for Tingbot, built in Javascript using [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

## To run

* bower install
* npm install
* webpack
* npm start

When developing, it's handy to use `webpack --watch --progress` and `npm start` at the same time in separate tabs. Code changes can then be reloaded without restarting the app (View > Reload).

## Contributing

on the architecture of Tide and how we want it to perform.

If you want to get involved:

- create an issue with the functionality you want to add
- if you have the know-how, submit a pull-request implementing/fixing something from the issues list.

If you're new to open source, welcome! This project should be a great way to get your feet wet.
